        <h2>🤖 Introduction to AI</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 1.6em; margin: 30px 0;">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the way we interact with technology, enabling machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.</p>
        
        <h3>What is AI?</h3>
        <p>AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. This includes capabilities such as reasoning, problem-solving, understanding natural language, and perception.</p>

        <h3>Key Concepts in AI:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> A subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.</li>
            <li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> The ability of machines to understand and interpret human language.</li>
            <li><strong>Computer Vision:</strong> The capability of machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual data from the world.</li>
            <li><strong>Robotics:</strong> The design and use of robots to perform tasks traditionally done by humans.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why AI Matters:</h3>
        <p>AI is transforming industries by enhancing efficiency, enabling better decision-making, and creating new opportunities for innovation. From healthcare to finance, AI applications are reshaping the future.</p>
